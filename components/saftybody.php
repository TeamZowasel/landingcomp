                        Zowasel screened enterprise buyers based on their company formation, payment terms, off-take
                        capacity, and financial
                        records to determine/verify proof of income and payments capacity.

                        Zowasel signs Fulfillment Agreements with buyers, after which the buyer issues payment
                        domiciliation to join the
                        platform.

                        Zowasel verifies every crop seller on the platform using their BVN, NIN, crop quality knowledge,
                        and souring networks to
                        determine/verify proof delivery capacity.
