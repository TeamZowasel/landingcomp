                            <h5>OUR STORY</h5>
                            <h2>We are Zowasel</h2>
                            <p>The idea of starting an agricultural technology company came as a result of our founderâ€™s
                                observation of how difficult
                                it was for his mother to access the market to trade her commodities and access credit to
                                finance her trade in Nigeria. </p>

                            <p>Today, the vision has created a robust ecosystem by building a sustainable agricultural
                                value chain. Offering easy,
                                fast, and accessible technology suited for both online and offline markets, enabling
                                farmers to increase their
                                productivity, better crop quality, and increase revenues by selling beyond their
                                traditional local markets</p>

                            <p>Zowasel is leveraging data science and artificial intelligence to improve productivity,
                                sustainability, and
                                profitability for smallholder farmers from seed to market.</p>
